**Big picture:** [MarineVerse Globe](https://www.marineverse.com/globe) lets you set a course on a 36-foot cruising yacht and cross oceans in real time with weather driven by actual forecasts. Sunrise, sunset, stars, squalls—the sim mirrors the world, day and night. Your boat keeps sailing while you're offline, so a long passage really takes… a long passage. Weeks to cross the Pacific feels like weeks—by design.

Why we built it: because a lot of you told us you want to **learn to cruise**, **practice for the real thing**, **retire into the Med**, or just **relax at sea** when life (or geography) keeps you on land. Others want to **chase records**, run virtual **Sydney–Hobart** attempts, or sail famous routes with friends.

## What Globe (Beta) looks like today:

* **Live weather + autonomous passage-making.** The sim uses forecast data; set heading, trim sails, and she'll keep going while you're away.

* **Land & seamarks.** You'll see coastline boundaries and seamarks derived from OpenStreetMap—so no cheating across continents, and proper [nav-practice at night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlbPLRz9Tdw). *(And yes, **do not** use this for real-world navigation.)*

* **The boat.** You're sailing a cruising yacht inspired by [S/V Uma](https://blog.marineverse.com/marineverse/sailing/vr/uma/2025/05/31/sv-uma-arrives-in-marineverse-sailing-club.html)—simple, robust, and built for miles.

* **AI Assistant** - You get access to an experimental AI assistant that is able to answer basic questions like "[What is the current bearing to Port of Melbourne](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/19R2lqqjZsA)?"

* **Platforms.** Best experienced in VR on **Meta Quest 3 / 3S** or **SteamVR**. (Quest 2 isn't supported.)

* **Availability.** It's part of the MarineVerse Sailing Club app on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1035320/MarineVerse_Sailing_Club/) and [Meta Quest](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/marineverse-sailing-club/2465388190184288/).

We've got **150+ sailors** actively testing Globe right now. Boats are moving 24/7. It's still beta—expect rough edges—but it's already good enough to learn, plan, and rack up serious miles.

## What people are doing in Globe

* **World cruising drills.** Plotting coastal hops and ocean legs along familiar and new coasts.

* **Relaxing sailing:**

* **Flotillas.** Skippers like **[Moira J](https://blog.marineverse.com/marineverse/globe/2025/08/14/sailing-seven-seas-marineverse-globe-experience-moira.html)**, **donjarrl**, and **Bob R** have been buddy-sailing since the beta started—Cape Town → Rio → Sydney → Fremantle → Darwin → Singapore → Tokyo → now pushing to **Anchorage, Alaska**—proving Globe is perfect for long, shared adventures.

## Get the most out of Globe

### If you're new

* **Track and tweak from the web.** Log in on the **[Globe Map](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/map)** to see where you are and review boat details. You can adjust essentials (like heading) between VR sessions.

<img src="/assets/globe/globe_details_page.jpg" style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

* **Zoom out to plan.** Use **Windy** or **PredictWind** to understand the bigger picture and plan smarter routes. Great "virtual tourism" with Wikipedia while you pass landmarks at sea. *(Use the links provided on the Globe website to open relevant locations)*

### If you're advanced

* **Use [OpenCPN](https://opencpn.org/) via our [NMEA feed](https://github.com/marineverse/globe-nmea-server).** Run a real chart plotter against your virtual boat and practice like you would offshore.

<img src="/assets/globe/open_cpn_globe.jpg" style="max-width: 800px; width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;"/>

* **Voice comms.** There's no in-app voice yet for Globe, so use **Discord** or your Quest voice calls to coordinate flotillas. (Discord link: [https://discord.gg/SH7krBjgSj](https://discord.gg/SH7krBjgSj))

## What's missing today (and what we're building next)

We're early—and we're building with you. Some of the top items on the roadmap:

* **Better in-boat chart plotter**

* **Richer landmasses and mountains** (beyond the current outlines).

* **More realistic weather visuals and wave physics.**

* **Deeper sailing mechanics:** reefing, better sail options (e.g., spinnaker/genoas), real consequences in heavy weather.

* **Ports/cities worth arriving at**

* **Optional hardcore mode** (grounding, getting truly "lost" if you mess up).

* **Events:** time trials (attempt any time, leaderboard by passage) and scheduled offshore races (everyone in the same weather window).

* **Improved multiplayer presence in Globe** (see each other, co-op watch-keeping, radio).

Add your voice and votes [here](https://www.marineverse.com/feedback/marineverse-sailing-club?search=globe) (we actually read and ship from this list).

## Two ways to start sailing this week

**Option A — Join a flotilla.**  
If you're already in the beta, we're organizing **Anchorage → San Francisco** departing **around 25th of August 2025**. Details in Discord ([#globe-beta](https://discord.gg/SH7krBjgSj)). Don't have your boat nearby? Use **Boat Delivery (teleport)** from your boat's page to reposition to Anchorage.

**Option B — Create your own Globe boat.**  
In the app: **Main Menu → Free Sail → Cruising Yacht → Globe → Create a Globe Boat**. You'll need a **Sailing Pass** (we're a small indie team—the pass funds servers, weather APIs, and ongoing dev). As of **15 Aug 2025**, there's a [**limited-time 50% Sailing Pass discount** via Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/marineverse).

## Why this matters

Globe is a safe, low-cost way to **practice real seamanship**—watchkeeping rhythms, weather windows, long-range planning, and night nav with lights and seamarks—without the calendar, cost, or risk. It's also a calm way to unwind: make a coffee, trim sails, watch the dawn, and log another 40 virtual miles before work. *(Again: **not for real navigation**—always use official charts in the real world.)*
