The Hansa 303 is celebrated globally for its stable design and user-friendly joystick tiller, a control system that translates perfectly to VR hand-tracking technology. By making it the default boat for newcomers, MarineVerse ensures that everyone's first virtual sailing experience is intuitive, confidence-building, and fun.

> "Hansa boats are built on universal design principles, making them accessible and enjoyable for anyone, including sailors with disabilities. Giving sailors a way to learn and practice in the virtual world is hugely valuable. For those in rehabilitation, it can provide not just skills, but motivation and confidence to engage with life and the sport."
> — **Paul Wager**, Trustee of Sailability Auckland and Secretary of the NZ Hansa Class

The project was developed with the enthusiastic support of Hansa founder Chris Mitchell and utilized 3D scans coordinated by Wager to create an authentic digital replica.

> "The first time I sailed a Hansa 303, I was struck by how its front-mounted joystick was a perfect match for VR. Its stability and intuitive controls make it the ideal ambassador for sailing. Our goal is simple: let more people sail more often, and the Hansa 303 is a massive step towards making that a reality for everyone."
