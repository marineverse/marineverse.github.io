Time flies! 

Next month marks an incredible **[8-year journey for MarineVerse](https://blog.marineverse.com/marineverse/2016/01/09/starting-marineverse.html)**. We are immensely thankful for your continuous support, which has been pivotal in making this project possible.

Together, **we are building the largest virtual sailing club** in the world. As this year draws to a close, we'd like to pause and reflect on the exciting journey of 2023. 

Join us as we share some of the standout moments and achievements.

**Check out this video for a quick overview:**

As you can see, 2023 was a big year for MarineVerse.

## Major MarineVerse Cup updates:

### Learning

Throughout the year, we've worked with the NauticEd team to expand our **'learn how to sail'** offerings. 

A lot of effort went into launching our [Docking course](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2023/05/04/practice-docking-in-vr.html), and we also created lessons on basic [Navigation Rules](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2023/03/06/nauticed-and-marineverse-navrules.html). You can find this content [in the NauticEd Training Room](https://www.nauticed.org/sailing-courses/view/virtual-reality-sailing) within the MarineVerse Cup.

### Relaxing

We know many of you enjoy using VR to explore and **relax**. That's why we're excited that we finally brought our **[Akalana Islands to the Meta Quest](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2023/07/20/catamaran-cruising-in-akalana-islands.html)** platform. It's a beautiful place to sail around virtually.

Have a look here:

### Try Before You Buy

Our mission at MarineVerse is to make sailing accessible and enjoyable for everyone, everywhere. We're happy to say we've come closer to that goal this year. Now, you can try MarineVerse Cup for free for 15 minutes on the Meta Quest store. And if you like it, you can get the full basic version for just $19.99 USD.

### Relaxing, Learning, Racing

As more and more people join MarineVerse Sailing, we want to make sure you get the most out of it. That's why we've made it possible for you to choose why you're playing each time you start the app. This way, MarineVerse can keep getting better and more fun for you:

## Quest 3 & Mixed Reality

In late September, the Meta Quest 3 was released, and we're thrilled to say that **MarineVerse Cup looks fantastic** on it! 

The text appears sharper and is easier to read, and the overall app experience is much smoother. If you're considering an upgrade, we definitely recommend going for the Quest 3.

<div style="text-align: center;">
	<img src="/assets/2023/quest3.jpg" alt="Quest 3" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;">
</div>

A standout feature of this new headset is the "Color Passthrough." This feature lets you see your actual surroundings while wearing the headset, creating an experience similar to Augmented Reality (AR glasses). This is why it's referred to as "Mixed Reality," as it blends both VR and AR in a single device.

We've leveraged this innovative capability to develop an experimental app called **Rigging Drill**. This app is a fun way to learn basic **sailing knots** and practice rigging a boat right in your living room. You can check it out here:

**Rigging Drill:** [https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6128861297199686](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6128861297199686)

<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M09cOe1bX74?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

During the development of the Rigging Drill, we've experimented not just with Passthrough, but also with hand tracking and voice recognition technologies. We're excited to apply the knowledge we've gained from this project to further improve MarineVerse in the coming year.

For those interested in learning sailing knots, don't miss out on trying the Rigging Drill app, available for free on App Lab: [https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6128861297199686](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6128861297199686)

## MarineVerse Cup Racing

The *"Daily Race Practice"* is a unique daily ghost racing event we host in the [MarineVerse Cup](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/2465388190184288/?utm_source=blog). 

<div style="text-align: center;">

Each day brings new wind conditions and a fresh race course. Sailors worldwide can submit their race entries within a 24-hour window. As the day ends, we tally the results and declare the day's winner. These daily results contribute to our Weekly, Monthly, and Seasonal rankings to determine the best sailors in the MarineVerse Cup.

Today marks the end of the **Autumn Race Series 2023**, and we're excited to announce the winners:

**Winter Race Series 2024 is starting today! Who will be the best sailor this season?**

If you're new to VR racing, now is the perfect time to dive in and hone your skills.

Our Daily Race Practice mode is known as "asynchronous multiplayer." This means you race solo but on the same track as others. The full thrill of racing comes alive when you're on the course with other players, navigating collisions, abiding by racing rules, and strategizing. That’s why we hope to take racing in MarineVerse Cup to the next level by introducing ranked, live multiplayer races.

## MarineVerse Cup Multiplayer

**Multiplayer event:** Every Sunday at 6 PM Central Time.

Since this October, we've been hosting regular Fun Races in the MarineVerse Cup multiplayer.

## MarineVerse Welcomes Kayaking

At MarineVerse, our passion for sailing is matched by our love for the water. Sometimes, when we're not sailing, we **enjoy a peaceful kayak paddle**. 

This year, we're thrilled to broaden our MarineVerse offerings by including kayaking, building on the hard work that went into developing the MarineVerse platform.

MarineVerse Kayaking on App Lab: 

[https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6511868632241917/](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/6511868632241917/)

<iframe width="100%" height="415" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NOFxGija64k?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

MarineVerse Kayaking, currently available in early access on App Lab, offers a VR experience of this serene yet physical activity. 

We're eager for you to try this initial version and share your thoughts with us. We're curious to know how you'd like us to develop this project further. Would you prefer it as a relaxing exploration activity, or should we focus more on fitness aspects? Share your ideas in the [MarineVerse Discord](https://discord.gg/marineverse), under the #kayaking channel.

And one more thing, till the end of 2023, you can get a massive 50% discount on MarineVerse Kayaking, by using the **“K2023-81FE89”** promo code at checkout. Enjoy!

## Looking ahead to 2024
Let's recap the significant progress MarineVerse made in 2023:

**Relaxing:** The stunning Akalana Islands, now explorable on Meta Quest 2 & 3.

**Learning:** Introduction of Docking & Rules training modules, alongside multiplayer lessons led by real sailing instructors.

**Racing:** We host regular and exciting weekly “Fun Race” in live multiplayer.

While we're proud of our achievements in 2023, we believe there's much more to explore in the realm of virtual reality sailing. Your feedback and participation are invaluable to us, and we're keen to know what aspects of MarineVerse you enjoy most and what improvements you'd like to see in 2024.
