If you’re like me, you can get a little nervous getting into a new marina. 

We all know a smooth docking is  a combination of technical skills, preparedness, and good communication with your crew. **And we usually don’t get many opportunities to practice.** 


<!--more-->

That’s why at MarineVerse, we are launching a 4-part series Virtual Docking Practice. 

Designed in collaboration with NauticEd, we've transformed [their popular online sailing course into several modules](https://www.nauticed.org/sailing-courses/view/maneuvering-under-power?school=marineverse&UTM_medium=blog&UTM_source=mv_nautic_ed) so you can safely  practise docking - without any pressure from the marina’s tourists.

What’s in the series? 

- **Momentum control:** Practise forward momentum in downwind and upwind conditions, and learn how to accelerate from a standstill.
- **Turning:** Master turning the boat, thrust bursts, figure 8s, and downwind turning.
- **Propwalk:** Experience and control prop walk in various situations, learn to use it to your - advantage, and overcome its challenges.
- **Spring lines:** Learn how to use spring lines effectively in various docking scenarios.
- *COMING SOON* **Leaving the dock:** Safely go out in various wind conditions
- *COMING SOON* **Returning to the dock:** Practise ferrying and Mediterranean mooring techniques to ensure a safe return to the marina.

The  modules will be released between May 4 and June 21st and  are available as part of [MarineVerse Sailing Pass](https://www.marineverse.com/sailing-pass). This week we are releasing Momentum control and Turning.
