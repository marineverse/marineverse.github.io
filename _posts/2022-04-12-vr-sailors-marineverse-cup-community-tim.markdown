We have asked Tim a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**

*I have learned how to sail as a teenager in a soapbox/dinghy (they called it an optimist) and a laser. I've spend a few weekends sailing with friends on lakes in the Netherlands, but that's it. I never raced or owned a boat.*  

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**

*Probably sailing a small boat on my own from A to B with the purpose of going somewhere for the first time. Yeah, it doesn't get much more exciting before VR for me*


**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*I don't really have any real life sailing experience and MarineVerse Cup is giving me a whole new look on competitive sailing. Playing the game unleashing my competitive self, it's making me want to learn more about the sport. I'm looking at real sailing videos. As a fan of sports simulation games, this is exactly what I'm looking for.*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*This is a great game for every sports game fanatic like myself. It's a must have for any (ex)competitive sailor or sailing lover.*

**Any tips for those new to sailing that want to race in MarineVerse Cup?**

*I came into this game with very limited knowledge of sailing, but as an experienced gamer. It's hard to master, but not too difficult to learn the basics. The people you come across online are usually very helpful and there's a Discord chat for the game where you can find more tips than I could give.*
