**Ahoy, MarineVerse Community!**

Since launching MarineVerse Cup in [February 2022](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2022/02/24/marineverse-cup-sails-onto-meta-quest-today.html), our journey has been one of growth, evolution, and reimagining what virtual sailing can be. While the app initially focused on sailboat racing, our vision was always much broader. We aimed to create a place where everyone—whether you're a seasoned sailor or a curious beginner—can experience the magic of sailing from home. Whether you want to race, learn, practice, or simply relax, MarineVerse is here for you.

Today, we’re proud to announce that **MarineVerse Cup is now [MarineVerse Sailing Club!](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/marineverse-sailing-club/2465388190184288/)**

## Why the Name Change?

Racing was our first chapter, but it was never meant to be the whole story. After our launch, we immediately got to work on broadening the experience. By October 2022, we introduced the **[NauticEd Training Room](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2022/10/05/nauticed-and-marineverse.html)**, a collaboration with the prestigious NauticEd online sailing school. This addition brought self-guided yacht mastery, navigation rules exercises, and a docking training module to the app. And this is just the beginning—our next step is to introduce new training modules, like Man Overboard drills, to further enhance the training experience.

But not everyone is here to race or train. For many of you, sailing is about freedom, exploration, and tranquility. Our Free Sail mode has always allowed players to sail without racing. However, we heard your feedback that part of the joy of sailing is the sense of exploration and discovery. In June 2023, thanks to newer, more powerful devices like Quest 2 and 3, we unveiled the stunning **[Akalana Islands](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2023/07/20/catamaran-cruising-in-akalana-islands.html)**—a gorgeous, explorable destination.

These developments have brought us to this moment. MarineVerse is no longer just about the Cup. It’s about racing, learning, and relaxing. It’s not just an app—it’s a club. Like real-world sailing clubs, we want to provide a place to try sailing, get lessons, compete in races, and connect with like-minded people.

That’s why **we're renaming MarineVerse Cup to MarineVerse Sailing Club**. This new name reflects the diversity of activities you can now enjoy in the app and the community spirit we strive to cultivate.


## What Does This Mean for You?

This change represents our evolution from a single-purpose app into something much greater:

- **Three Experiences in One:** Relax, Learn, and Race.
- **A True Sailing Club Feel:** Meet, sail, and compete with a global community of sailors.
- **Ongoing Updates:** Expect continuous improvements, new training modules, and expanded exploration areas.

To be clear, **the MarineVerse Cup brand will live on within the "Racing" section** of the new app, representing our ongoing dedication to virtual regattas, leaderboards, and thrilling competition. But now, with MarineVerse Sailing Club, you’ll have access to an even wider world of sailing experiences.

## What's Next?

Renaming an app is no small task. Over the next few weeks, you may still see references to "MarineVerse Cup" as we update our website, store listings, and in-app menus. We appreciate your patience as we work through this transition.

In the meantime, keep exploring, learning, and racing. We’re incredibly excited for what’s ahead, and none of it would be possible without [you—our incredible community](https://www.marineverse.com/members).

Thank you for being part of this journey. We can’t wait to welcome you to the MarineVerse Sailing Club.

Happy sailing,

Greg (and the whole MarineVerse team)
