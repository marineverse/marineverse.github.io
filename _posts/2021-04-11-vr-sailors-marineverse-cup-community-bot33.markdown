Ahoy!

Welcome to the sixteenth post in the series **"VR Sailors - MarineVerse Community"** - introducing sailors racing in [MarineVerse Cup](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup).

Today, we are chatting with **Dave Syer** from United Kingdom.

In virtual reality, you can meet Dave in MarineVerse Cup as bot33. In MarineVerse Cup Dave is racing in a "Pro Series" and [as of today is #15 in the world](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup/rating/pro).

We have asked Dave a couple of questions..

**What is your name (or online persona), and where are you based**

*I am "bot33" based in London. There's a bot player in the game called "bot3" that used to collide with me a lot. I changed my tag to "bot3" to try and confuse it, but I don't think it worked - it only confused the other humans - eventually the humans asked me not to use "bot3" so I switched to "bot33".*

**What is your sailing experience?**

*I learned to sail dinghies in 2019 (Wayfarer and Bosun), and don't have too much experience in real life since then. Got to RYA Level 2 so I could sail in the club boats and get some practice, but then COVID hit and everything shut down. I messed about a bit in Laser Picos at the Docklands club (https://dswc.org), and on a Hobicat on holiday in St. Lucia.*

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**

*We chartered a yacht (with skipper) for a couple of days just before COVID, and I look at the photos a lot. Sun, sand, snorkelling, and great scenery.*

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup?**

*I was kind of interested in VR from a technology point of view, but sailing was the main reason I got the headset. It felt like I was back on the water and I was hooked immediately. I'm usually really pleased if I place in the top 10 in the Daily Races (globally), so the highlight for me was winning the Pro Yacht Race (once only) on a day when Markolus, DTB Rastan and KonaCal31 were all sailing.*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*Anyone who loves sailing, or wants to learn the basics. I wasn't really motivated by racing when I started but it's really good fun so I compete most days now; don't be put off by the competitive side if that doesn't sound like your cup of tea. I also think it would be very good experience for anyone who can't get out on the water in real life, and I know we have quite a few people in that category in our community.*

**Any tips for those new to sailing that want to race in the MarineVerse Cup?**

*The MVC community is really a great bunch of people - very welcoming and helpful if you need tips or just want to chat. Drop into Discord and join the crew. Other than that, remember that sailing is a little bit complicated, and MVC is quite faithful to real life, so you have to stick with it to get the most out. I suppose if it was too easy it wouldn't be as rewarding.*
