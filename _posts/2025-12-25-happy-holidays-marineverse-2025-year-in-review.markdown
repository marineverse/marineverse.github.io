Ahoy MarineVerse Community!

As the year comes to a close, I want to say a huge thank you for being part of the MarineVerse sailing community.

Whether you race with us every week or only check in once a year, you're a big part of why this project is still sailing forward.

This year we've added new boats, new ways to relax, new training tools, and more racing than ever - perfect reasons to put the headset on over the Xmas break and see what's new.

## New to VR sailing? Start with Hansa 303

If you (or someone in your family) are trying VR sailing for the first time, we've added a simple, highly accessible training boat: **Hansa 303**.

It's based on a real-world sailboat used in Sailability programs and rehab - very stable and joystick-controlled, so it's a gentle, confidence-building first sail.

## Want to relax? Cruise on S/V Uma or explore the Globe

For those who want something more relaxing this holiday season:

**Step aboard S/V Uma**, the famous electric cruising yacht from Sailing Uma. We've built a digital replica you can walk inside and sail in VR.

**[Sail S/V Uma](https://blog.marineverse.com/marineverse/sailing/vr/uma/2025/05/31/sv-uma-arrives-in-marineverse-sailing-club.html)**

**Continue your journey in [MarineVerse Globe](https://blog.marineverse.com/marineverse/globe/2025/08/14/introducing-marineverse-globe-beta.html)** - real weather, day/night cycle, 24/7 sailing and global exploration.

This year we've added:

* Landmasses and coastal details
* Stats & achievements for passages, visited seas and ports
* Community offshore races like Anchorage to San Francisco, San Francisco to Valparaiso, Melbourne to Wellington, Wellington to Sydney, and now upcoming **[Sydney to Hobart](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/races/93ec893b-673c-4498-a965-33ca9c60bcb8)**

Sailing Pass members can also try experimental exploration levels with 3D cities (powered by Google Earth Maps API) in Free Sail. For a limited time, you can secure your MarineVerse Club membership with a special 50% off promotion - the perfect moment to upgrade and see everything we've been building.

VR sailing with MarineVerse is perfect for a quiet sail between holiday meals.

## Want to learn or train? Docking & Pro mode

On the learning side, we've expanded:

**Our popular VR Docking exercises with a 40-foot cruising catamaran with twin engines** - a great practical bridge between theory and real-world manoeuvring.

**[Try Catamaran Docking](https://blog.marineverse.com/nauticed/marineverse/2025/12/19/catamaran-docking-marineverse.html)**

**An experimental "Pro simulation" mode for the yacht in Free Sail** - for those who want a more realistic, demanding sailing model.

**[Learn about Pro Simulation](https://www.patreon.com/posts/going-pro-first-133781763)**

**A new experimental AI coach**, available on the website and in the app via the Quick Menu, to help answer questions and guide your learning in MarineVerse.

**[Try the AI Coach](https://www.marineverse.com/ai)**

If you're thinking about levelling up your sailing in 2026, these are good places to start.

## Let's sail more often - and share it with others

Over the Xmas break, I hope you'll get a chance to:

* Jump back into MarineVerse for a quick relaxing sail
* Try something new - whether it's the Hansa 303, S/V Uma, Globe, docking, Pro Sim or a bit of racing
* If you're a regular, please consider sharing the gift of sailing by inviting a friend or family member for a short VR sail

Thank you again for being part of the MarineVerse community and for supporting virtual sailing.

I wish you a wonderful holiday season and happy sailing!

**Happy sailing!**

*Greg on behalf of MarineVerse team.*
