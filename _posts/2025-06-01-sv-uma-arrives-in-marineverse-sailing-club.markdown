We’re thrilled to welcome a legend to MarineVerse Sailing Club.  
S/V Uma—the world-traveling electric cruiser featured on the YouTube channel *[Sailing Uma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQyy_nQzWBg)*—is now fully available to sail in VR.

**Kika Mevs 🇭🇹** and **Dan Deckert 🇨🇦** have spent the past decade restoring Uma and documenting their journey as they’ve sailed over **28,000 nautical miles**, from the tropics to the Arctic. Their story has inspired millions around the world to rethink what’s possible—both in sailing and in life.

Now, you can step aboard their boat yourself.

With direct input and feedback from Dan and Kika, we’ve recreated **S/V Uma** as the **first dedicated cruising yacht** in MarineVerse Sailing Club. Whether you’re learning to sail, dreaming of passage-making, or just want to relax on the water—Uma is your new home base.

> *“Seeing her come alive in VR is surreal. The layout feels exactly like home, right down to the cockpit proportions,”* says **Kika**.

> *“Our mission has always been to democratise sailing. Uma is the perfect ambassador. She proves you don’t need a brand-new yacht to chase big dreams—now you don’t even need water.”* adds **Greg Dziemidowicz**, MarineVerse founder.

> *“The first time we stepped aboard her in VR, we were blown away. It’s surreal how familiar it feels,”* Dan says.  
> *“For a virtual experience, it’s impressively realistic,”* Kika adds. *“Steering, sail trim and boat handling all feel intuitive and real—an excellent tool for learning fundamentals before ever stepping onto a boat.”*
