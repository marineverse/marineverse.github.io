As we near the end of the year, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on 2022 and share some behind-the-scenes updates with you. 

**Check out this video for a quick overview:**

As you can see, 2022 was a big year for MarineVerse. We launched [MarineVerse Cup on the Quest store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2465388190184288/?utm_source=blog), grew our team, partnered with NauticEd, and expanded the training portion of MarineVerse Cup. Our avatars even got a fancy update!


But that's not all. Just yesterday, we shipped a brand new boat: [a long-requested](https://feedback.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup) catamaran! Inspired by classic racing catamarans, this new addition is sure to provide you with exciting new sensations and maybe even bring back some childhood memories.

Speaking of boats, we now have five sailboats in the game: the dinghy, yacht, Waszp, Opti, and the new catamaran. If you're interested in the history of MarineVerse Cup (now in its third year), we've created a dedicated page where you can track its progress: [https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup/history](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup/history)

Our mission at MarineVerse is to inspire, train, and connect sailors around the world. We want to democratize access to sailing and its culture, and we made great progress towards that goal this year by bringing the app to the official Quest store. The Quest store is the biggest storefront and most popular VR platform, and our presence there has helped us reach even more people and make sailing more accessible.

We're also excited to report that this year, we made MarineVerse Cup available in Polish. This is just the first step towards adding more languages in the future.

One of the things I'm personally most excited about is [our partnership with NauticEd to develop VR sailing training content](https://www.marineverse.com/learn-how-to-sail). This will be a great resource for people who want to learn how to sail in a safe and fun virtual environment. Look out for more updates on this in 2023.


While we're proud of the progress we made in 2022, there's still so much more we can do to reach the full potential of virtual reality sailing. We value community feedback and interaction, so please let us know in the comments below what you enjoy about MarineVerse today and what you'd like to see us develop and improve in 2023.


With that, we wish you a lovely holiday season. 


**Happy sailing!**
