**Melbourne, Australia - April 13th, 2022** – The MarineVerse team is excited to announce that the first free update for the ultimate VR sailing experience, [MarineVerse Cup](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2465388190184288), is available now on Meta Quest 2. As well as listening to community feedback and streamlining the experience, [Sailing Pass](https://www.marineverse.com/sailing-pass) users can now learn to use a new boat - the MarineVerse Opti.

The MarineVerse Opti is based on a classic design made for kids and teenagers learning to sail. Now sailing enthusiasts can relive memories of their first time sailing, or those new to the sport can experience what it feels like to operate a smaller, simpler craft. MarineVerse Cup has also received various improvements and bug fixes, and based on community feedback the team has made the registration process much simpler.

Additionally, this first big post-launch update is just the beginning of an exciting content rollout planned for the rest of the year. Sailing veterans and players who want to experience the joys and relaxation of navigating the seas can expect more boats, race replays and live leaderboards, as well as gameplay improvements and polish.


*“We’re really happy with the positive reception and feedback we received from both the sailing and gaming communities since the game launched out of early access on February 24th”,* said Greg Dziemidowicz, Lead Developer for MarineVerse. *“We have a lot of plans for MarineVerse Cup and we can’t wait to share more information in the coming months, so stay tuned!”.*

From competitive play, to pressure-free leisurely trips surrounded by sea, sunshine and the sound of the waves lapping the boat, MarineVerse Cup features a host of different modes catering to all kinds of sailors and experiences. The game offers solo, co-op or multiplayer sailing, including the option to compete against friends and other players. There are also leaderboards, mini-games, daily practice races, leagues and seven spectacular locations from across the globe.

Created by a team of sailors and engineers, MarineVerse Cup is designed to bring the world of sailing to anyone who may not have the time, physical stamina or access to a boat to enjoy the sport - or you can brush up on and practice your sailing skills in the middle of winter! With differing weather conditions to contend with, such as varying winds with gusts and lulls, the many courses available will challenge you differently each time for hours of replayability and offer a real test of your sailing prowess.
