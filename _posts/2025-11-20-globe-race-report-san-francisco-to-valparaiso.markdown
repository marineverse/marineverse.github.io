**The Pacific Challenge concludes (for most!) as the fleet touches down in Chile.**

After nearly two months at sea, the leaders of the [MarineVerse Globe Beta](https://blog.marineverse.com/marineverse/globe/2025/08/14/introducing-marineverse-globe-beta.html) fleet have arrived in **Valparaiso, Chile**. Launching from San Francisco on **September 22, 2025**, this race was a true test of patience, routing strategy, and beta-testing resilience. ( [See leaderboard](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/races/ac5e2106-8600-4c85-b609-3cc340a29deb) )

Unlike short regattas, the Globe requires 24/7 vigilance, real-time weather routing, and the mental fortitude to handle the Doldrums. From navigation by stars to coding custom VMG calculators, this leg showcased the incredible depth of our community.

## 🏆 The Podium

A massive congratulations to our top finishers who navigated the high-pressure systems and equatorial crossings with precision:

🥇 **1st Place: [Canada III](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/fdf59dbb-bb25-4561-8ac1-1797cf96b999) 🇨🇦 (Skipper: J J)**
* **Finish Time:** Nov 10, 2025, 10:53:22 UTC
* **Performance:** J J ran a clinical race, maintaining a dominant lead through the final stretch to claim the top spot for Alberta and Canada.

🥈 **2nd Place: [donjarrl](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/f932bfa4-d924-4ec7-b7f8-ef24b91e5096) 🇨🇦 (Skipper: donjarrl)**
* **Finish Time:** Nov 10, 2025, 12:05:21 UTC
* **Performance:** A Volunteer and Community Leader, donjarrl kept the pressure on Canada III right to the end, finishing just over an hour behind after weeks of sailing.

🥉 **3rd Place: [Irish Talkers](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/e6327b9c-c351-4cb7-a0c4-b2e980c2f716) 🇮🇪 (Skipper: Moira J)**
* **Finish Time:** Nov 11, 2025, 09:44:03 UTC
* **Performance:** The "Voice of the Fleet." Moira secured a podium finish while simultaneously managing the fleet's morale and data analysis.

## 📊 Daily Race Reports & Tools from the Fleet

A huge thank you to **[Moira J](https://www.marineverse.com/members/aDNU4rbMhTvhC4zM12v8SWVoa4qfyquKPklpSx2beskeuHQ)**, who truly led the race organization and performed a monumental amount of work for the community. For almost 60 days, her daily race reports [in Discord](https://discord.gg/SH7krBjgSj) became the heartbeat of the event.

We were treated to daily breakdowns of position changes, gaps in nm, and efficiency percentages ("100% = you basically sailed straight at the target, 55% = you went sightseeing"). She even included ETA guesses and callouts when someone snuck past a rival at 03:00 UTC.

Beyond the reporting, Moira developed and shared a custom **COG/SOG/VMG calculator** that became essential for the fleet. It helped skippers understand:
* How much of their speed was actually towards Valparaíso.
* How different headings and currents changed their VMG.
* Why "100% towards target" doesn't always mean you're winning.

As J J summed it up: the calculator and reports became part of everyone's daily routine. Thank you, Moira!

## 🌦️ Weather Nerd Corner: Models, Currents & High-Pressure Purgatory

This leg turned into a mini weather seminar. Skippers compared [ICON](https://windy.app/blog/what-is-icon-weather-model-forecast.html), [GFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Forecast_System), [ECMWF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Centre_for_Medium-Range_Weather_Forecasts), and other models on Windy to plan their tactics, with the fleet diving deep into which global models perform best in the eastern mid-Pacific.

The Humboldt Current, combined with shifting highs off Chile, punished anyone who got greedy or stayed in the wrong lane too long. We saw:
* Boats stuck in wind holes for days ("Finnbuck has sailed into a hole… the "coffee" is gone… morale is low").
* Others threading narrow bands of breeze and suddenly gaining 100+ nm on the fleet.
* The fleet bunching as everyone tried to stay west of high pressure but still lay a course to Valparaíso.

It was exactly the kind of planning, patience, and frustration you'd expect from a real ocean race—just with VR headsets and Discord instead of foulies and a wet chart table.

## ⚔️ The Mid-Fleet Battle

The fight for the mid-pack was intense. **[Celestial](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/318befdd-eff9-4131-ae61-f1b0da094ad4) (Solo Flyer)**—formerly known as Finnbuck—battled hard for 4th place, arriving on Nov 13th. Solo Flyer brought real-world grit to the virtual ocean, even experimenting with coding a real-star catalog for celestial navigation during the race.

Close behind were **[Damienlemarin](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/3f1785c4-5664-4041-9f7a-75c47923f363) 🇫🇷** (5th) and **[Bing A Ling](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/10ede7c7-ec5d-4d18-8167-7b2862c8ed00) 🇺🇸** (6th), who traded positions multiple times over the 50+ day journey. **[STORMERIN](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/619cc283-f193-45c9-bfee-89d48897146a) 🇨🇿** (Filip Dymak) and **[Bobber](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/d6e41839-8553-4674-bf60-8f1660e0a54f) 🇺🇸** (Bob R) rounded out the finishers, with Bobber making a late surge in better winds to finish on Nov 16th.

## 🐛 Community Spirit & "Beta" Adventures

This race wasn't just about speed; it was about survival in a Beta environment.
* **The "Grid" & Waves:** Skippers sometimes battled wave generation anomalies, with seas occasionally looking like "lake water" one minute and monster waves the next. *(Note: This is something we are working on fixing soon!)*
* **Hard Landings:** The "visual navigation" into Valparaiso proved tricky, with **[Captain Jay](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/a70a9a83-0269-46a3-a243-6d91340d8b4d)** unfortunately finding the land a bit too literally just 4nm from the finish line.

## 🌊 Still at Sea

The race isn't over yet! We still have brave sailors fighting the light winds and high-pressure ridges:
* **Captain Jay** (Currently stuck on land/near finish - tugboats dispatched!)
* **Honest Aaron** (Racing - approx 97nm to go)
* **KC2684 2** (Racing - approx 141nm to go)

Honest Aaron is currently projected to edge out KC2684 for the next finish slot, but the winds off the Chilean coast remain fickle.

## 📅 What's Next?

With the fleet converging in South America, eyes are turning toward the next challenge across the Tasman Sea.

* **Next Leg:** [Melbourne, Australia to Wellington, New Zealand](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/races/d483d6a9-ba54-47c5-8d92-1b94f9377bae).
* **Start Time:** 23/11/2025, 09:15 PM UTC
