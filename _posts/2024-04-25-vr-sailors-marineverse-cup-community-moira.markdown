In virtual reality, you can meet Moira in MarineVerse Cup as [Moira Jane](https://www.marineverse.com/members/aDNU4rbMhTvhC4zM12v8SWVoa4qfyquKPklpSx2beskeuHQ). In MarineVerse Cup, one of the series Moira is racing in is "Yacht Pro Spring Race Series 2024" and [as of today is #16 in the world](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup/races/weekly-race-series/IwHQmiCRDEmxb_hjAGCBEiPhVloM9uDv1--up1frzdvrtxc).

We have asked Moira a couple of questions..

**What is your sailing experience?**

*I have sailed since learning dinghy sailing at age 17, got my Royal Navy dinghy skipper cert at age 18, bought my Swift 18 in 1977, and upgraded to Swift 23 in 1980.* 

*Gained Coastal Skipper qualification in 1985. Went on several flotilla sailing holidays in Greece and Turkey. Did a cross-channel Medway to Ostend and back in 1989, and a delivery cruise from Portugal to Madeira in 1990. Since then, only a little crewing in SW Ireland.*

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**

*Swimming with pilot whales off Tenerife while doing my coastal skipper practical.*

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Cup? Any good memories or highlights?**

*Coming to MarineVerse with much knowledge of sailing, it was interesting to see how well MarineVerse has translated the mechanics into the digital world.*

*Altogether they have done a great job, and the sailing is immersive and quite realistic. I greatly enjoy the races and have been racing [Yacht Zone 6](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup/leagues/yacht-zone-6) and Pro every day for the past two months since I qualified.* 

*I also race dinghy most days and even tried out the amazing Waszp, though I have yet to get to grips with its unusual performance.*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Cup**

*Anyone with an interest in sailing whether or not they have any experience* 

*Someone new to the sport would need a learning curve but it will give them a good idea of what it is like in the real world and would get them off to a good start in the real world.*

**Any tips for those new to sailing that want to race in the MarineVerse Cup?**

*Just do it! Being last is no disgrace however disappointing - you will only get better with practice.*
