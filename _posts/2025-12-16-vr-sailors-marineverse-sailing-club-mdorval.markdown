In virtual reality, you can meet Marc as [MDorval](https://www.marineverse.com/members/E3zk0y0mK4mur077l9SxSmdn8htQIq-y8nwg1IRMmH4y2DI). MDorval races in [Yacht Pro](https://www.marineverse.com/marineverse-cup/rating/pro) with a current rating of 1270 (as of 16 December 2025) and in Globe sailing his cruiser [Sail Matrix](https://www.marineverse.com/globe/boats-profiles/a6ae0fcf-3ac7-4332-94c5-78ab98fd2256).

We have asked Marc a couple of questions..


**What is your sailing experience?**
*"I've been sailing since the age of 5. Starting as a kid with my parents on their Wayfarer, I had my own Optimist at 8. We started inland keelboat sailing when I was 12. As a young adult, I primarily sailed on a CL16 with the occasional bareboat charter of keelboats."*

**What is your favourite sailing memory?**
*"Taking a summer off with my girlfriend and running weekday charters on our family keelboat. The money was okay, but the sailing was awesome!"*

**Tell us something about your experience with MarineVerse Sailing Club? Any good memories or highlights?**
*"I really enjoy using MarineVerse to practice skills (still have much to learn). In particular, practicing [docking maneuvers](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2023/05/04/practice-docking-in-vr.html) in various wind conditions is really helpful for building confidence in real life.*

*I am in awe of the racing skills on display in MarineVerse. It's a great way to learn new ideas and to improve."*

**Who and why should try MarineVerse Sailing?**
*"I think anyone who really enjoys sailing and wants to improve should use MarineVerse. It's a very good simulation."*

**Any tips for those new to sailing that want to race in MarineVerse?**
*"For those wishing to race, make sure to watch replays of your (and other) races. You'll learn lots by seeing others' tracks and behaviours."*

To access Race Replays in MarineVerse app, select Racing -> Coaching -> Race Replays.

**Anything else you'd like to share?**
*"With the new Globe feature, you can now practice your navigation and planning skills too! Great fun."*
