Docking. It's the moment where even seasoned sailors hold their breath. The wind catches the bow, the current pushes the stern, and suddenly that slip looks very narrow.

Two years ago, we introduced [Docking practice to MarineVerse Sailing Club](https://blog.marineverse.com/cup/2023/05/04/practice-docking-in-vr.html), giving monohull sailors a safe, stress-free environment to master slow-speed maneuvering, prop walk, and wind effects. It quickly became one of our most popular training features.

Today, we are thrilled to announce a major expansion to our Docking training modules. We're handing you the keys (or rather, the dual throttles) to a **Dual Rudder Catamaran**.

## The Catamaran Difference: A New Challenge

If you're used to docking a single-engine monohull, stepping onto a catamaran is a whole new world. It's not just about having more beam; it's about mastering a completely different propulsion system.

With twin engines spaced wide apart, you gain an incredible advantage: **differential thrust**.

As demonstrated in our latest gameplay video, you no longer rely solely on the rudder for low-speed turning. By putting one engine in forward and the other in reverse, you can spin the catamaran literally within its own length.

But the real magic - and the hardest skill to master in the real world - is **"crabbing" or walking the boat sideways**. By balancing opposing throttles and turning the wheel against the momentum, you can slide horizontally into a tight dock space without moving forward or backward.

It looks like magic when a pro does it at the marina. Now, you can learn to do it too.


## The Missing Link Between Theory and Reality

We've always believed that VR is the ultimate training ground for sailing. It is the practical, hands-on bridge between studying theory and taking the helm of a real vessel.

When it comes to maneuvering under power, the theory is essential. We highly recommend [NauticEd's comprehensive course on Maneuvering Under Power](https://www.nauticed.org/sailing-courses/view/maneuvering-under-power?school=marineverse&UTM_medium=blog&UTM_source=mv_nautic_ed) to understand the physics of prop walk, pivot points, and windage.

But reading about differential thrust and actually feeling how sensitive those twin throttles are? That's a different story.

Trying your first catamaran "pivot turn" in a crowded marina with a rented boat is a recipe for high blood pressure - and potentially expensive gelcoat repairs. MarineVerse Sailing Club allows you to build muscle memory and confidence in a zero-risk environment. You can crash our virtual catamaran into the dock 50 times so that when you do it for real, you get it right the first time.


## Ready to take the helm?

The update is live now in [MarineVerse Sailing Club](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2465388190184288). Grab your controllers, step onto the wide bridge of the catamaran, and start practicing those twin-throttle maneuvers today.

To access the Dual Rudder Catamaran, select NauticEd Training Room -> Docking -> Power -> Power Cat.

We'll see you on the docks!
