Created by a team of sailors and engineers, MarineVerse Cup is designed to bring the world of sailing to anyone who may not have the time, physical stamina or access to a boat to enjoy the sport - or you can brush up on and practice your sailing skills in the middle of winter! With differing weather conditions to contend with, such as varying winds with gusts and lulls, the many courses available will challenge you differently each time for hours of replayability and offer a real test of your sailing prowess.

To support you in your foray into the world of virtual sailing, Marineverse has put together a handy [collection of tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9mH-_5OYgfLJKDC4-WKG2AHs0DareuYW) that will help you get the most of MarineVerse Cup, covering everything from the 101’s of sailboat racing, to the technicalities of sailing upwind.
